Tips related to recon 

1)Define Your Objectives: Clearly outline what information you're looking to gather and why. This could be related to network security, competitive intelligence, or any other purpose.

2)Use Multiple Sources: Relying on a single source for information can be risky. Utilize a variety of tools and methods such as OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), social media, public records, and specialized tools for network reconnaissance.

3)Stay Legal and Ethical: Ensure that your reconnaissance activities comply with legal and ethical standards. Avoid unauthorized access to systems or data.

4)Be Stealthy: Minimize the footprint of your reconnaissance activities to avoid detection. This could involve using techniques like passive scanning and avoiding activities that trigger security alerts.

5)Keep Learning: Reconnaissance is an evolving field. Stay updated with the latest tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities. Engage with the security community through forums, conferences, and online resources.

6)Document Everything: Keep detailed records of your reconnaissance activities, including the tools used, the information gathered, and any insights gained. This documentation can be valuable for analysis and reporting.

7)Analyze Information: Reconnaissance is not just about collecting data but also about analyzing it to extract meaningful insights. Look for patterns, connections, and vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

8)Practice OPSEC (Operational Security): Be mindful of your own digital footprint and take precautions to protect your identity and privacy while conducting reconnaissance activities.

9)Customize Your Approach: Tailor your reconnaissance strategy to the specific target or objective. Different targets may require different tools and techniques.

10)Stay Persistent: Reconnaissance can be a time-consuming process, especially for complex targets. Stay persistent and methodical in your approach, and be prepared to adapt as new information comes to light.

Remember, the goal of reconnaissance is to gather actionable intelligence while minimizing the risk of detection or compromise. By following these tips, you can conduct more effective and responsible reconnaissance activities.

Website Where you find information for your target.

Certainly! There are several websites and tools available that can help you find the domain of a particular website. Here are a few:

1>WHOIS Lookup Services: Websites like whois.com, who.is, and ICANN WHOIS Lookup allow you to search for domain registration information, including the domain name associated with a particular website.

2>DNS Lookup Tools: DNS lookup tools like DNSstuff, MXToolbox, and WhatIsMyDNS can provide information about the DNS records associated with a domain, including the domain name itself.

3>Domain Name Search Engines: Domain name search engines like DomainTools and Domainr allow you to search for domain names based on keywords or phrases, which can help you identify the domain associated with a particular website if you know part of the domain name.

4>Subdomain Finder Tools: As mentioned earlier, tools like Subdomain Finder (subdomainfinder.c99.nl) can help you find subdomains associated with a domain, which can give you insight into the domain structure of a particular website.

5>Web Browser Address Bar: In many cases, simply entering the URL of a website into the address bar of a web browser will display the domain name in the address bar itself. This is one of the simplest methods to find the domain of a particular website.

These tools can be useful for various purposes, including reconnaissance, domain research, and troubleshooting DNS-related issues. Just remember to use them responsibly and within legal boundaries.

In the last! I can say that you can use your kali linux or any alternate of them to gather more information about that target because specifically kali linux comes with many tools that you can use for you bug hunting journey. 

Hope you will be successful a your Bug Hunting journey and Be safe and USE your skills in a right way.
